# 单样本假设检验

## 概念

### 零假设和备择假设

1. A **null hypothesis H0** is a statistical hypothesis that contains a statement of equality, such as $\le$, =, or $\ge$.
2. The **alternative hypothesis Ha** is the complement of the null hypothesis. 
It is a statement that must be true if H0 is false and it contains a statement of strict inequality, such as $>$, $≠$, or $<$.

例如：

$$
\begin{cases}
    H_0: \mu\le k\\
    H_a: \mu > k
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\begin{cases}
    H_0: \mu \ge k\\
    H_a: \mu < k
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\begin{cases}
    H_0: \mu = k\\
    H_a: \mu \ne k
\end{cases}
$$

### 错误类型

Because your decision is based on a sample rather than the entire population, there is always the possibility you will make the wrong decision.
